# Landing Page Tailwind CSS

Implementing a landing page using ReactJS for the frontend, based on an exercise from: https://www.figma.com/design/pFtdMqmlsPdRNMWl5k01qa/Ecomail-test-(Oxana-Gre%C5%A1likov%C3%A1)?node-id=0-1&t=1Zny3icWI2QHTvsb-1

## Technologies

- Vite
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS and Flowbite for styling
- Hooks for state management
- Axios for HTTP requests

## Setup

1. Download or clone the repository

```

https://github.com/oxanakraynova/landing-page-tw.git

```

2. Install NPM packages

```

npm install

```

3. Run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

```

npm run dev

```

## Status

Unfortunately, the GET `fakeStoreApi` endpoint doesn't have pagination right now, and I can't do part of the exercise to load more products.
